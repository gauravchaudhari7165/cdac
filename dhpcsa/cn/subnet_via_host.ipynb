    "\n",
    "Each class of IP address has a different number of bits assigned for network and host portions. The IP addresses are calculated based on the binary representation of these addresses. Here's how it's done for each class:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class A Example (Range Calculation)\n",
    "- **First octet range:** 1 – 126.\n",
    "- **Network portion:** First 8 bits (1 byte).\n",
    "- **Host portion:** Last 24 bits (3 bytes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- **Smallest address:** `1.0.0.0` (binary: `00000001.00000000.00000000.00000000`)\n",
    "- **Largest address:** `126.255.255.255` (binary: `01111110.11111111.11111111.11111111`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class B Example (Range Calculation)\n",
    "- **First octet range:** 128 – 191.\n",
    "- **Network portion:** First 16 bits (2 bytes).\n",
    "- **Host portion:** Last 16 bits (2 bytes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- **Smallest address:** `128.0.0.0` (binary: `10000000.00000000.00000000.00000000`)\n",
    "- **Largest address:** `191.255.255.255` (binary: `10111111.11111111.11111111.11111111`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class C Example (Range Calculation)\n",
    "- **First octet range:** 192 – 223.\n",
    "- **Network portion:** First 24 bits (3 bytes).\n",
    "- **Host portion:** Last 8 bits (1 byte).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- **Smallest address:** `192.0.0.0` (binary: `11000000.00000000.00000000.00000000`)\n",
    "- **Largest address:** `223.255.255.255` (binary: `11011111.11111111.11111111.11111111`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Calculate Network and Host Ranges:\n",
    "1. **Identify the class of the IP address** by looking at the first octet.\n",
    "   - If it's 1 – 126, it's Class A.\n",
    "   - If it's 128 – 191, it's Class B.\n",
    "   - If it's 192 – 223, it's Class C.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Convert the first octet to binary** and look at the number of bits allocated for the network and host.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **For each range**:\n",
    "   - The network bits are fixed (as defined by the class).\n",
    "   - The host bits can vary to give different addresses within the network range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Calculation:\n",
    "#### For IP Address `192.168.1.0` (Class C):\n",
    "- **Class C** has 24 bits for the network and 8 bits for the host.\n",
    "- Network bits: `192.168.1` (fixed).\n",
    "- Host bits: `0` (can vary from 0 to 255).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the valid IP range in this network is:\n",
    "- **First Address (Network ID):** `192.168.1.0`\n",
    "- **Last Address (Broadcast Address):** `192.168.1.255`\n",
